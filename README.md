# Hello, World
Hello, World is an application intended to connect divided communities. Hello, World will connect people from differring
social, political, and religious views so that we may finally have an open, constructive dialouge.

## Where we are now
This project is still very much in development. We aim to provide an iMessage-like interface for chatting and implement a
feature allowing people to meet in person if they choose to divulge their information on a per-user basis.
